\large Development of proper geometries and measurement and reduction of Aerothermal loads on on the geometry or the geometry designed, plays an important role in the design and analysis of Hypersonic Vehicles, The important of Double Cone geometry is is the nature of the flow on the the axis-symmetric geometry and how the nature of the shock wave boundary layer changes along the flow processes, The flow features that have been obtained from the current numerical investigation of Hypersonic Flow are highly unsteady flow features that are necessary in the prediction of the flow features along the wall of the double cone geometry.

\large The current study has been done and validated using ANSYS ICEM CFD for reprocessing and FLUENT for solver processes and analysis, CFD Post and Python for post processing and validation. The current validation for the flow is by measurement of convective heat transfer and variation of pressure coefficient along the surface of the double cone geometry and validating with the experimental results obtained from Gnoffo.P [7] work.
